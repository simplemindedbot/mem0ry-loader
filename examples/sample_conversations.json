Since you're most productive late at night, here's a structured approach:\n\n**Phase 1: Foundation (3-4 months)**\n- Python fundamentals (leveraging your programming background)\n- NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation\n- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization\n\n**Phase 2: Core ML (4-6 months)**\n- Scikit-learn for traditional ML\n- Statistics and linear algebra refresher\n- Jupyter notebooks workflow\n\n**Phase 3: Deep Learning (6+ months)**\n- TensorFlow or PyTorch\n- Neural networks, CNNs, RNNs\n\nGiven your night owl schedule, consider setting up a consistent 2-3 hour study block during your peak hours.
