# Next Steps & Future Roadmap

This document outlines immediate next steps for users and potential future enhancements for the MemLoader project.

## üöÄ Immediate Next Steps for Users

### 1. Initial Testing & Validation

- [ ] **Run sample processing**: Test with `examples/sample_conversations.json` first
- [ ] **Dry-run validation**: Use `--dry-run` to validate extraction quality before uploading
- [ ] **Model comparison**: Test both Ollama (local) and OpenAI (cloud) to compare results
- [ ] **Confidence tuning**: Experiment with different `--confidence-threshold` values (0.5-0.9)

### 2. Production Deployment Decision

- [ ] **Self-hosted evaluation**: Test local Ollama processing for privacy/cost benefits
- [ ] **Cloud evaluation**: Test OpenAI batch processing for speed/scale benefits
- [ ] **Complete self-hosting**: Set up OpenMemory for local memory storage
- [ ] **Hybrid approach**: Use self-hosted for initial processing, cloud for final cleanup
- [ ] **Cost analysis**: Compare actual costs vs. estimates for your data volume

### 3. Full Conversation Processing

- [ ] **Backup your data**: Ensure conversations.json is safely backed up
- [ ] **Start with batch processing**: Use `--use-batch` for 50% OpenAI cost savings
- [ ] **Monitor progress**: Use `--verbose` to track processing and catch issues early
- [ ] **Incremental processing**: Consider processing conversations in chunks by date range
